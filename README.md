A comprehensive scientific report detailing the biophysical risks (heat and EMF) to infant squirrels from in-nestbox live-streaming cameras.

Comprehensive Scientific Report: Biophysical Risks of In-Nestbox Cameras
Overview

This repository contains the full text of a comprehensive scientific report evaluating the biophysical risks—primarily heat and electromagnetic fields (EMF)—posed to newborn squirrels by live-streaming cameras installed inside nest boxes. This document serves as a foundational scientific resource, providing detailed analysis, quantitative data, and evidence-based recommendations.
Key Contents of the Report

    Detailed Thermal Load Analysis: Calculates the total heat energy (in watts) introduced into a nest box by multi-camera systems under various performance scenarios (Low, Medium, High power). Considers both 3-camera and 4-camera setups.

    Quantitative Temperature Prediction: Utilizes a thermodynamic model to forecast the final internal nest box temperature, combining the effects of external solar radiation and internal camera heat.

    Biophysical Impact Assessment: Explains the physiological effects of severe heat stress (hyperthermia) on altricial newborns and discusses the concept of the "ecological trap."

    EMF Risk Evaluation: Assesses the potential risks of chronic, close-range exposure to EMF from Wi-Fi transmitters based on the precautionary principle, and includes a summary table of relevant scientific studies.

    Ethical Analysis: Measures the practice of in-nestbox observation against established ethical guidelines for wildlife research, such as the principle of non-maleficence.

    Concrete Recommendations: Provides a detailed, actionable list of solutions, from immediate actions to long-term system redesigns, to mitigate the identified risks.

Project Goal

The purpose of this report is to provide an objective, evidence-based foundation for discussion and action. It is intended for channel operators, viewers, animal welfare organizations, and researchers to understand the full scope of the problem and work towards creating safe and ethical wildlife observation practices.
